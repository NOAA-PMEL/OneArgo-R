RELEASE NOTES FOR USERS OF THE ONEARGO-R TOOLBOX

Version 1.0.1

This version is an upgrade of the to version 3.0 of the BGC-Argo-R
toolbox (described below).

It expands access to all Argo float data. The select_profiles
function now has an additional optional argument 'type', whose value can
be set to either 'bgc', 'phys' (core and deep),  or 'all' (default setting).
If the type is not specified, but sensors are, the type will be set
to 'bgc' if sensors other than pressure, temperature, and/or salinity are
selected.

Previously written scripts that use select_profiles calls that implicitly
assume BGC only floats (but not specify BGC sensors) should 
have 'type','bgc' added to the calls to the select_profiles function.

In previous versions, all floats that are listed in the Sprof index
file were considered BGC floats. However, there are (183, as of
April 2022) floats that are listed in the Sprof index file, but
have only physical (pressure, temperature, salinity) sensors. These
will now be labeled as physical floats.

For BGC floats, only Sprof (not prof) files will be downloaded and used,
even if only physical variables (p, T, S) are currently used for plots etc.

RELEASE NOTES FOR USERS OF THE BGC-ARGO_R TOOLBOX

Version 3.0 (May 2022)

This version adds a new type of plot (time series) that can be used
either per float or with multiple floats in one plot. If it is used
to plot each float's time series separately, a second variable can
be plotted for comparison.

The missing function get_lon_lat_time required in the Main_workshop 
has been added (load the lon, lat and time from specified floats).
The plot functions and get_multi_profile_mean were corrected to be able 
to deal with selections of floats that does not all show the wanted variables.

A bug in the plot_profile function were corrected in order to actually 
plot all profiles of selected floats (and not only one float data).

The depth_interp function was modified so it can now skip profiles with 
not enough PRES values.


Version 2.1 (January 2022)

The most important change since version 1.0 regards the evaluation of
the index file (argo_synthetic-profile_index.txt). Previously, its
information was used to determine the number of profiles for each float
and the availability of sensors. Now it is only used for an initial
selection of potential floats. Then the matching Sprof files are
downloaded (if necessary), and the indices of matching profiles are
determined from the Sprof file.
This required a change in all functions and scripts that call function
select_profiles. The previous call signature was
with "profiles" and "floats" as outputs.
The new output are "float_ids" and "float_profs".

That is, the previous second return value is now the first return value.
Instead of a global profile index (the previous first return value) there
is now a cell array with per-float profile indices as the second return
value. This cell array can be used directly as value for the
'float_profs' key in variable arguments in calls to functions
show_trajectories, show_profiles, show_sections, load_float_data and
get_lon_lat_time.
The total number of matching profiles can be computed with, e.g.:
sum(lengths(output_of_select_profile_function$float_profs))
The p2f and fprofid members of global Sprof were deleted.

The Float$wmoid array is now stored as numbers instead of strings.

initialize_argo.R has some sections rearranged, so that all user-specific
settings are at the beginning of the function in a clearly delineated block.

show_profiles, show_sections, show_trajectories:
The first argument must always be an array of float IDs.
Variable option 'type' is obsolete and will be ignored. Subsets of
profiles can be specified with the 'float_profs',float_profs key/value option.
main_workshop.m was updated to show the revised way of calling these functions.

show_trajectories has a new option 'position' with possible values 'first' or
'last' to show only the first or last position of each specified float.
It also has a new option 'title' that allows the user to specify a custom
title for the plot (default is "Float trajectories").

select_profiles now allows the selection of floats and profiles (in addition
to lon/lat/time and sensor) by 'ocean' ('A', 'P', or 'I') and 'mode'
('R' = real time, 'A' = adjusted, 'D' = delayed mode; any combination
of these can be used).

Auxilary functions have been moved to a dedicated folder (now called in the main_workshop).

A function has also been created to load/install the required packages (load_library.R).

Load_float_data has a new option  ‘format’ , which allows the users to specify the format of 
exported float data  (‘list’ or ‘data frame’).

 A new created function namely “get_lon_lat_time’ enables  the users to extract the longitude, 
latitude and sampling date by given a set of float IDs and profile index.
