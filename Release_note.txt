RELEASE NOTES FOR USERS OF THE BGC_ARGO RTOOLBOX

Version 1.1 (January 17, 2022)

The most important change since version 1.0 regards the evaluation of
the index file (argo_synthetic-profile_index.txt). Previously, its
information was used to determine the number of profiles for each float
and the availability of sensors. Now it is only used for an initial
selection of potential floats. Then the matching Sprof files are
downloaded (if necessary), and the indices of matching profiles are
determined from the Sprof file.
This required a change in all functions and scripts that call function
select_profiles. The previous call signature was
with "profiles" and "floats" as outputs.
The new output are "float_ids" and "float_profs".

That is, the previous second return value is now the first return value.
Instead of a global profile index (the previous first return value) there
is now a cell array with per-float profile indices as the second return
value. This cell array can be used directly as value for the
'float_profs' key in variable arguments in calls to functions
show_trajectories, show_profiles, show_sections, load_float_data and
get_lon_lat_time.
The total number of matching profiles can be computed with, e.g.:
sum(lengths(output_of_select_profile_function$float_profs))
The p2f and fprofid members of global Sprof were deleted.

The Float$wmoid array is now stored as numbers instead of strings.

initialize_argo.R has some sections rearranged, so that all user-specific
settings are at the beginning of the function in a clearly delineated block.

show_profiles, show_sections, show_trajectories:
The first argument must always be an array of float IDs.
Variable option 'type' is obsolete and will be ignored. Subsets of
profiles can be specified with the 'float_profs',float_profs key/value option.
main_workshop.m was updated to show the revised way of calling these functions.

show_trajectories has a new option 'position' with possible values 'first' or
'last' to show only the first or last position of each specified float.
It also has a new option 'title' that allows the user to specify a custom
title for the plot (default is "Float trajectories").

select_profiles now allows the selection of floats and profiles (in addition
to lon/lat/time and sensor) by 'ocean' ('A', 'P', or 'I') and 'mode'
('R' = real time, 'A' = adjusted, 'D' = delayed mode; any combination
of these can be used).

Auxilary functions have been moved to a dedicated folder (now called in the main_workshop).

A function has also been created to load/install the required packages (load_library.R).
